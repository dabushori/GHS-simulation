# GHS-simulation

This repo contains an implementation of the GHS (Gallager, Humblet and Spira) distributed algorithm to find an MST and communication with the root of the found MST using the sinalgo simulator.

This repo is configured as an IntelliJ project using the [sinalgo-Intellij](https://github.com/shimitapiro/sinalgo-Intellij) repo. The repo contains all the configuration files in the `.idea` directory and in the `sinalgo-work.iml` file.

This is my project for the Distributed Algorithms M.Sc. course.

To read more about the project, read the [project specification](./Project%20Specification.pdf), the [project's description file](./src/projects/mmn15/description.txt) and [my report](./report/Distributed%20Algorithms%20Project.pdf).
